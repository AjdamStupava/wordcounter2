I choose to worship
I choose to bow
Though there’s pain in the offering
I lay it down

Here in the conflict
When doubt surrounds
Though my soul is unravelling
I choose You now

I will praise You through the fire
Through the storm and through the flood
There is nothing that could ever steal my song
In the valley You are worthy
You are good when life is not
You will always and forever be my song

I build my altar
Right here and now
In the midst of the darkest night
It won’t burn out

For You are perfect
No matter what
In the joy or the suffering
I sing it loud

When the enemy says I’m done I lift my praises
When my world comes crashing down I lift my praises high
Till the darkness turns to dawn I lift my praises
I choose to worship, I choose You now
